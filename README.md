üõ†Ô∏è Solving a Real Hostel Problem 

I'm a student at SSN College of Engineering, staying in the hostel. With the rainy season approaching, mosquitoes have started entering rooms more frequently ‚Äî especially at night.

One night, I woke up due to a mosquito bite and realized the reason ‚Äî my friend had come into my room and left without closing the door. He does this often, and that‚Äôs how mosquitoes keep getting in.

To fix this, I designed a simple prototype using basic electronics to ensure the door doesn't stay open unintentionally.

How It Works:

*I designed a system using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and an ultrasonic sensor, both embedded at the door-closing point inside the wall.

*When the door is opened, the LDR is exposed to light, which automatically triggers the system.

*The ultrasonic sensor then detects motion to confirm someone is leaving the room.

*If the door remains open (LDR still detects light), the system activates a buzzer to alert the person.

*Once the door is closed, the LDR is covered again (dark), which resets the system and stops the buzzer.

‚úÖ This setup ensures the door is always closed after someone leaves, preventing mosquitoes from entering and making the room more comfortable and healthier.
